## Development Workflow

```bash
npm install         # install dependencies
npm run dev         # start local dev server at localhost:4321
npm run build       # production build → dist/
npm run preview     # preview the built site locally
```

---

## Deployment

- **Automatic:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds and deploys to `https://wavecoaching.github.io`
- **Manual trigger:** via GitHub Actions UI or `./infra/scripts/deploy.sh`
- **One-time repo setup required:** GitHub repo Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"

See `infra/README.md` for full deployment details.

---

## Build Conventions

- Pages go in `src/pages/` — Astro uses file-based routing
- Shared UI goes in `src/components/`
- Page layouts (nav, footer, etc.) go in `src/layouts/`
- Static files (images, PDFs) go in `public/`
- Tailwind classes are used for all styling — no separate CSS files unless necessary

## Notes for Claude

- This is a static site — no server-side rendering, no database, no API routes
- Keep pages lean; prefer composing from small components
- The site URL is `https://wavecoaching.github.io` (configured in `astro.config.mjs`)
- The GitHub repo must be named `wavecoaching.github.io` under the `wavecoaching` account
- Do NOT add a `base` path in Astro config — this is a root pages site
